## Notes

I have written this after an experience, let me describe:

After having changed my birthday every two weeks and getting people constantly wishing me happy birthday, I realaized that some of the use of social media was not being effective.

I thought I'd help out my friends with the trouble of even having to open it up. After all, they seem to be doing a machines work if they can't even find out that they already wished me happy birthday 7 times that same year!

## Personal Social Media Philosophy

I think social media is a great tool. However, the way people use it is not right. 

Social media should not be used to stay in touch with people you are already in touch with. It should be used to find people you lost contact with, get their phone numbers and enjoy a drink face to face, or maybe a phone call. Most of the information that comes out of social media is just noise. Why would I care what a friend I haven't seen in the past 4 yours has had for lunch today, or the color of his brand new t-shirt? I really should only be interested if his current location is near mine so that we can catch up. After all, 4 years ago we did spend a lot of time together.
